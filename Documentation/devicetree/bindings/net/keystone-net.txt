This document describes the device tree bindings associated with the
keystone network driver support.

tx_channel: the packet dma channel name associated with tx
rx_channel: the packet dma channel name associated with rx
reg:        the regsiter start address and the szie that will be
            used by the driver.

Below we provide 2 examples.

veth: veth@2a6c000 {
	compatible = "ti,keystone-veth";
	tx_channel = "vethtx";
	rx_channel = "vethrx";
};

netcp: netcp@2090000 {
	reg = <0x2090000 0xf00>;
	compatible = "ti,keystone-netcp";
	tx_channel = "nettx";
	rx_channel = "netrx";
};
